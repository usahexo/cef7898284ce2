#  Where to Enter Gambling Winnings on TurboTax

If you're a winner, where do you report your gambling winnings on TurboTax? 

The good news is that gambling income is considered taxable income in the US. The bad news is that it can be a bit complicated to determine how much of your winnings are taxable. 

To help make it easy, TurboTax has a special category for gambling income and losses. Here's how to enter your gambling winnings on TurboTax: 

1. Go to the “My Income” section of your return and select “Wages, Salaries, and Tips.” 
2. Under “Other Income” select “Gambling Winnings.” 
3. Enter the amount of your gambling winnings for the year. 
4. If you had any gambling losses, enter those as well. TurboTax will automatically subtract them from your winnings to give you your net gambling income for the year.
5. Select the appropriate tax form depending on your filing status and whether you’re claiming any deductions or credits related to gambling. 
6. Review and print your return.

That's it! Reporting your gambling income is simple with TurboTax. We'll take care of all the calculations and help make sure you get every deduction and credit you're entitled to.

#  What to Do with Gambling Winnings on TurboTax

There are a few options for what to do when you have gambling winnings on your TurboTax return. You can claim the winnings as income, subtract the losses from the winnings to avoid paying taxes on the entire amount, or take a tax deduction for gambling expenses.

If you claim the winnings as income, you will have to pay taxes on the full amount. However, if you subtract the losses from the winnings, you will only have to pay taxes on the net amount. This can be helpful if your winnings are relatively small compared to your losses.

You may also be able to take a tax deduction for gambling expenses. This includes things like admission fees, transportation costs, and lodging costs. However, you can only deduct these expenses if they were necessary for you to earn the taxable income. For example, if you stayed at a casino hotel so that you could gamble all day and night, you can deduct the cost of your room. However, if you only gambled for a few hours one evening and then went back to your regular hotel, you cannot deduct the cost of your room.

If you hit it big at the casino and are wondering how to report gambling winnings on TurboTax, don't worry – we're here to help. In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to correctly report your winnings on TurboTax, as well as some important tips to keep in mind. So whether you're a first-time gambler or a seasoned pro, read on for everything you need to know about reporting gambling winnings on TurboTax.

To begin, you'll need to gather some information about your gambling activity. This includes the date of your gambling activities, the amount of money you won or lost, and whether any losses were claimed as deductions in previous years. Once you have this information handy, you can start filling out your tax return.

The first thing you'll need to do is enter your total gambling income in the "Income" section of your return. This includes all of the income you earned from gambling activities, both wins and losses. You should also note that TurboTax will automatically calculate your losses for you based on the information you provide.

Next, you'll need to report any winnings that exceed $5,000. To do this, simply fill out Form W2-G and attach it to your tax return. This form reports any taxable gambling winnings that exceed $5,000, and it's important to note that these winnings are subject to federal income tax.

Finally, if you lost money while gambling in 2018, you may be able to claim those losses as deductions on your tax return. To do this, simply fill out Part II of Form 1040 (the "Other Taxes" section), and enter the amount of your losses in line 28 (other miscellaneous deductions). Keep in mind that only net losses can be claimed as deductions – in other words, subtract any wager or purchase amounts from your gross losses to find your net loss amount.

That's everything you need to know about reporting gambling winnings on TurboTax! For more information or assistance filing your taxes this year, be sure to contact a qualified tax professional.
