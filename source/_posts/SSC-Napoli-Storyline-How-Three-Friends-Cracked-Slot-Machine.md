#  SSC Napoli Storyline: How Three Friends Cracked Slot Machine

The three friends were on a vacation in Naples, Italy and they stumbled upon a slot machine in one of the casinos. They each put in €5 and started playing. The first two rounds, they lost. But the third round, they hit the jackpot and each won €1,000.

This got them thinking about how to crack the slot machine. They figured out that if they bet all their money on one spin, there was a higher chance of winning. And that's what they did in the fourth round. And they hit the jackpot again! This time, they won €10,000 each.

They were so happy and excited! They had cracked the slot machine and won big money. They went back to the casino twice more and won €2,000 each time. So in total, they walked away with €25,000 – more than enough to cover their vacation expenses.

What a lucky break for these three friends!
