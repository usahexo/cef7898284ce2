# How much exp for lvl 50 roulette ffxiv Rikvip?

Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed and published by Square Enix. In the game, players can earn experience points (exp) by completing various tasks such as quests, dungeons, and trials. One way to earn exp efficiently and quickly is by completing the daily roulettes.

Roulettes are a type of random queue system that includes different content such as dungeons, trials, and raids. Players can queue for roulettes once a day, and once they complete them, they receive bonus exp and other rewards. For players who have reached level 50 in FFXIV, there is a specific roulette known as the Level 50 Roulette that they can participate in.

The Level 50 Roulette allows players to complete various dungeons that were previously released in the game, and it provides bonus exp upon completing it for the first time each day. The amount of exp that players can earn from the Level 50 Roulette varies depending on their current level and the dungeon they complete.

For example, if a player completes the Level 50 dungeon known as Snowcloak, they can earn around 400,000 exp at level 50. However, if they complete a different Level 50 dungeon known as the Keeper of the Lake, they can earn around 650,000 exp at level 50. These values may vary depending on the player's current level and the exp buffs they may have.

In addition to exp, completing the Level 50 Roulette also grants players Allagan Tomestones of Poetics, which can be used to purchase various items such as weapons and armor. This allows players to gear up their characters and progress further in the game.

Overall, the amount of exp that players can earn from the Level 50 Roulette in FFXIV Rikvip varies depending on the dungeon they complete and their current level. However, it provides a great way for players to gain exp efficiently and earn valuable rewards at the same time. So, if you're looking to level up your character quickly, be sure to queue up for the Level 50 Roulette!
