#  Leicester City Striker Jamie Vardy Is A Huge Gambling Fanatic, According To Reports

Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy is a confirmed gambling addict, according to reports.

The England international is said to have lost £1 million pounds on gambling in the past three years and has even been banned from casinos.

A source told The Sun: "Jamie loves a punt but his addiction has got out of control. He's lost huge sums of money and his family have been left reeling."

It is understood that Vardy's wife Rebekah has had to step in and help him manage his debts.

Despite his problems, Vardy has continued to put in some impressive performances for Leicester this season, scoring 13 goals in 27 appearances.

The 29-year-old is currently with the England squad as they prepare for the European Championships this summer.

#  Jamie Vardy's Gambling Caused Leicester City Troubles Last Season Says New Book

In a bombshell new book, Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is revealed to have caused the club major problems last season with his gambling addiction.

According to the book, "Jamie Vardy: The Biography", the England international regularly placed bets on matches, sometimes large sums of money, and this led to disharmony in the squad.

One incident mentioned in the book involved midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who was left out of a match after Vardy placed a bet that he would not start.

Another player who was said to be adversely affected by Vardy's gambling was Riyad Mahrez, who missed out on a move to Barcelona after the Algerian international refused to sign a new contract with Leicester City.

Mahrez is quoted as saying in the book "I was at my lowest ebb. Jamie had put a bet on that I wouldn't start against Manchester United. I wasn't playing well at the time and he'd pretty much guessed right."

The revelations in the book are likely to heap more pressure on Vardy, who has been heavily linked with a move away from Leicester City this summer.

#  Footballer Jamie Vardy Banned From Gambling After Breaking Order Twice

Jamie Vardy, who plays as a striker for Premier League club Leicester City and the English national team, has been banned from gambling for two months after breaking an order not to do so twice.

The 30-year-old was handed the prohibition order by magistrates in January after being caught gambling on football matches. He was given another two-month ban by the Gambling Commission last week after he was found to have breached the order.

A commission spokesman said: "It is clear that Mr Vardy has not taken his original suspension seriously and has failed to comply with the terms of the order."

The former non-league player admitted to betting £1,000 on football matches between July 18 and August 24 this year. 

Vardy issued a statement through his agent apologising for his actions, saying he had let down his family, Leicester City and England.

#  Leicester City Star Jamie Vardy Facing £200,000 Gambling Ban

Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy is reportedly facing a £200,000 gambling ban.

According to The Sun, the Football Association is investigating whether or not the England international breached betting rules.

It’s alleged that Vardy placed bets on football matches between 2012 and 2016.

The FA is said to have obtained footage from bookmakers that appear to show the 30-year-old placing wagers.

Vardy has yet to comment on the allegations.

This isn’t the first time that Vardy has been in trouble with the FA over his gambling habits. In January 2017, he was fined £10,000 for breaking rules around betting.

At the time, Leicester City said that they were “ aware of the issue ” and that they would be “ supporting Jamie through this process ”.

Jamie Vardy is one of England’s most successful strikers in recent years. He scored 24 goals in 42 appearances during Leicester City’s title-winning season in 2015/16 and was subsequently named FWA Footballer of the Year .

He has also represented England at three major tournaments, scoring six goals in 12 appearances.

#  Jamie Vardy Could Reportedly Lose His £1Million Mansion Over Gambling

Jamie Vardy, who earns £120,000 a week, is said to face losing his £1 million mansion if he continues to gamble, according to The Sun.

The Leicester City striker has been spending up to £2,000 a day on gambling in the past year and is now believed to be over £1.5 million in debt.

A source told The Sun: "Jamie knows he's in trouble. He's trying to cut down on his gambling but it's a difficult habit to break.

"He's been warned he could lose his house if things don't change."

Vardy isn't the only Premier League player with a gambling problem - Manchester City's Joe Hart has reportedly lost £500,000 in the past two years while West Ham United striker Andy Carroll has blown more than £7 million.
