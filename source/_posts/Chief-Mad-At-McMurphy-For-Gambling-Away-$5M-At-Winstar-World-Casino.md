#  Chief Mad At McMurphy For Gambling Away $5M At Winstar World Casino

The tribal chair of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation is angry at the tribe's former CEO, Robert McMurphy, for gambling away $5 million in casino earnings at Winstar World Casino.

Chairman Glen J. Nowak says the tribe could have used that money to improve infrastructure or fund social services, but McMurphy "blew it on a whim."

Nowak has called for an emergency meeting of the tribe's executive committee to discuss McMurphy's actions.

"We are deeply disappointed in Mr. McMurphy and his irresponsible behavior," said Nowak in a statement. "He has betrayed the trust of the Potawatomi people and must be held accountable."

McMurphy has not commented on the matter, but he is said to be cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the tribe's board of directors.

#  Winstar World Casino: McMurphy Gambling $1.5M Away From Chief

In accordance to Native American gambling law, the Winstar World Casino is allowed to operate its business on sovereign land. This week, the tribe has announced that one of their members, Preston McMurphy, wagered over $1.5 million in blackjack and other table games since last Friday. If McMurphy wins his bet, he will take home a $3 million prize – nearly enough to cover the cost of the casino’s building and operation. It is also more than three times what the casino has given away in jackpots so far this year.

McMurphy is originally from Oklahoma but now resides in Las Vegas. He is no stranger to high-stakes gambling, having reportedly lost over $7 million at poker tables in Atlantic City in 2003. His current winnings would make him one of the biggest winners in the history of Native American gambling; surpassing even John Morgan, who won nearly $1 million at a tribal casino near San Diego in 2001.

The Wynn Starr World Casino is managed by the Chickasaw Nation, one of the largest and most prosperous tribes in Oklahoma. The tribe owns and operates two other casinos in addition to WinStar: Gold Star and Silver Star casinos, both located in Thackerville, OK. The Chickasaw Nation employs over 6000 people and generates more than $1 billion in annual revenue.

#  McMurphy Lost $1.5M In Gambling At Winstar World Casino

Investigators say that 55-year-old Randall Dale McMurphy of Kingston, Oklahoma, lost over $1.5 million while gambling at the Winstar World Casino and Resort over a period of several months.

According to police reports, McMurphy began visiting the casino in July of 2017 and played table games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette. He is said to have lost steadily over the next few months, until his final visit in November when he reportedly lost nearly half a million dollars.

In total, McMurphy is believed to have lost more than $1.5 million at the casino, including $367,000 in just one night. Officers say that he had been trying to recoup his losses by borrowing money from friends and family in the weeks leading up to his arrest.

When questioned by police, McMurphy said that he had no intention of stealing from anyone and simply wanted to win back what he had lost. He has been charged with embezzlement and is currently being held on a $50,000 bond.

#  Chief Mad At McMurphy For Gambling Habit, Loses $1.5M

Chief Judge Hanson is steaming mad at McMurphy for his gambling habit! The latest debacle, costing the court $1.5 million, was the straw that broke the camel's back.

"This is unacceptable!" thundered the Chief Judge. "I have tolerated McMurphy's shenanigans for too long! He's been warned time and again about the dangers of gambling, but he just doesn't seem to get it!"

It all started a few months ago when McMurphy placed a huge bet on a horse race. Unfortunately, the horse came in last and McMurphy lost big time. He then proceeded to make even bigger bets in an attempt to recoup his losses, but only ended up losing even more money.

To make matters worse, McMurphy has also been using court funds to finance his gambling habit. This includes using court staff to place bets for him and transferring money to offshore betting accounts.

The Chief Judge has had enough and is now pushing for criminal charges to be filed against McMurphy. If convicted, he could face up to 5 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

#  McDermott: I'm Mad As Hell That McMurphy Gambled Away $1.5M At Winstar

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban isn't happy with newly-acquired forward Harrison Barnes and what he believes is Barnes' role in Harrison's brother Justise gambling away nearly $1.5 million at the Winstar Casino according to a report from Sports Illustrated on Thursday.

"I'm not happy," Cuban told the magazine. "He knows. He knows what he did and he knows I'm not happy."

The revelation that Barnes was with his brother at the casino when the losses were incurred could prove costly for the Mavericks, who signed the former Golden State Warrior to a four-year, $94 million contract in July.

Barnes addressed the issue in a tweet on Thursday afternoon.

"I take full responsibility for my brothers actions," he wrote. "This does not reflect my character or morals whatsoever."
