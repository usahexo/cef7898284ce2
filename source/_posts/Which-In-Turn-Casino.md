#  Which In Turn Will You Play?

Video gaming has now become a household pastime, enjoyed by people of all ages. It wasn't always this way, however; video games have a long and winding history, full of bizarre and exciting twists and turns.

Like any other form of entertainment, the video game industry owes much to chance and circumstance. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the most important moments in video game history, from the very first arcade game to the rise of esports.

The Birth of Video Games

Video games as we know them began life in the early '70s, when physicist Ralph Baer began work on a television gaming console. This console was different from anything that had come before it; it allowed players to interact directly with on-screen images.

Baer's invention would lay the groundwork for future gaming consoles, including the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System. It also spawned a whole new genre of entertainment – one that quickly became popular among both children and adults.

The Golden Age of Arcade Games

In the early '80s, arcade games were all the rage. This was thanks in part to classics like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Space Invaders. These games were simple but addictive, and they quickly became fixtures in arcades across the world.

To capitalize on this trend, Atari released a series of flashier and more complicated arcade games. Titles like Asteroids and Missile Command were huge hits, garnering widespread popularity among gamers young and old.

The Console Wars Begin

In 1985, Nintendo released its Famicom console in Japan. This 8-bit system was a huge success, eventually finding its way to North America under the name NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). With its iconic design and groundbreaking games like Super Mario Bros., NES quickly became one of the most popular gaming consoles ever made.

Atari didn't take this sitting down; they soon released their own 16-bit console, the Atari Jaguar. However, this system failed to find an audience, due in part to its high price tag ($250) and lack of good games. Ultimately, Nintendo would come out on top in what is now known as The Console War Era .
