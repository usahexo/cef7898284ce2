#  Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange Says Gambling Is Unlawful In Alabama

Alabama Attorney General Luther Strange ruled in December that all gambling is unlawful in Alabama, a move that could have consequences for the state’s two casinos as well as its burgeoning electronic gambling industry.

The ruling came in response to an inquiry from state Rep. Ed Henry, who asked Strange whether bingo, charity poker and other games were legal in the state. In his letter to Henry, Strange wrote that all forms of gambling are illegal in Alabama with a few exceptions such as lotteries operated by the state or one of its political subdivisions.

Strange’s ruling dealt a potentially fatal blow to the state’s two casinos, which have been struggling financially in recent years. The VictoryLand casino in Macon County has closed twice in the past two years due to financial difficulties, and the Greenetrack casino in Greene County has laid off workers and reduced its hours of operation.

Gambling supporters say Strange’s ruling will also kill the state’s electronic gambling industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years. At least six companies offer electronic gambling machines in some of Alabama’s larger cities, and lawmakers have been considering legislation that would regulate and tax the industry.

Strange’s ruling was praised by some religious groups who see gambling as a sin, but it was condemned by others who said it will cost the state jobs and revenue. Casino officials say they are considering filing a lawsuit to challenge Strange’s ruling.

#  Alabama's Gambling Laws Remain A Gray Area

Alabama's gambling laws are a bit of a gray area, as there are no real statutes that specifically mention gambling. This means that the legality of gambling activities in the state depend largely on the opinion of law enforcement and local courts.

There are some general laws that can be applied to gambling cases. For example, the state's code of criminal procedure prohibits betting or wagering on any type of game or contest. This law could be used to prosecute players who gamble in an unauthorized casino or card room, or those who place bets on sporting events.

Another law that could be applied to gambling offenses is the state's postal fraud statute. This law prohibits anyone from using the mail service to dishonestly obtain money or property. This law has been used in the past to prosecute operators of illegal online casinos that accepted payments from Alabama residents.

However, there are no specific laws in Alabama that prohibit most other forms of gambling, such as playing poker or slots at a friend's house or participating in online fantasy sports leagues. This means that these activities are generally considered legal unless they are specifically banned by local ordinance.

Despite this lack of clarity, law enforcement officials in Alabama have been known to crack down on illegal gambling operations. In 2016, for example, authorities raided several illegal casinos and card rooms throughout the state. So far, no one has been arrested as a result of these raids, but players at these establishments could potentially face charges if they are caught.

#  Horse Racing Is The Only Form Of Gambling That's Legal In Alabama

Alabama is one of the states in the United States that have legalized gambling. Horse racing is the only form of gambling that is legal in Alabama. There are no casinos, no lotteries, and no bingo halls in the state.

The only place where people can bet on horse races is at the tracks. There are three race tracks in Alabama, and all of them are located in Mobile County. They are:

• The Mobile Greyhound Park
• The Mobile Bay Casino and Racing Park
• The Fairgrounds Race Course

#  Why Aren't Casino Games Legal In Alabama?

Alabama is one of the few states in the US that does not have any casinos. This is surprising because casino games are generally very popular and can be quite lucrative for the state. So, why aren't casino games legal in Alabama?

One possible reason is that Alabama has a very conservative population. The majority of Alabamians may not want to see their state adopt casino games, which they may see as morally questionable.

Another possibility is that Alabama officials simply don't think that casino games would be lucrative enough to make it worth legalizing them. Casino games are often associated with gambling addiction, and this could be a concern for officials in Alabama.

Finally, it's possible that Alabama officials are afraid of the negative consequences that legalized casinos could have. Casinos can lead to money laundering and organized crime, and these are issues that Alabama officials may not want to deal with.
