#  Bettors going all-in on Super Bowl

Las Vegas casinos took a beating on the Super Bowl, with some losing as much as $10 million on Sunday’s game. But many bettors also lost big, including one who put down nearly his entire net worth on the Baltimore Ravens.

John Avello, Executive Director of Race and Sports Operations at Wynn Las Vegas, said his book took a $3 million loss on the game. “The public was all over the Ravens and they lost by only two points so it was pretty devastating,” Avello told The Huffington Post.

Other casinos reported similar losses. MGM Resorts International, which operates 10 Strip casinos including Mandalay Bay and The Mirage,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) said it lost about $7 million on the game. Caesars Entertainment, which operates nine Strip and downtown casinos including Caesars Palace and Bally’s, said it lost about $4 million.

While bettors looking for a long shot sometimes hit big payouts, the vast majority lose money in the end. In 2012, Americans wagered a record $119 million on the Super Bowl, but lost an estimated $1.16 billion in the process, according to the University of Nevada Las Vegas’ Center for Gaming Research.

Nevada sports books have made money in only eight of 46 Super Bowls since 1984 when they first started tracking betting data , according to gaming research analyst Michael Lawton. And while they profited slightly overall last year — thanks in part to some well-placed prop bets — they still suffered an estimated $3 million loss on the Denver Broncos’ victory over the Seattle Seahawks .

Despite those long odds, bettors continue to flock to Las Vegas every year to put their hard-earned cash on the line in what has become America’s biggest unofficial holiday . “It doesn’t matter whether we win or lose, people are always going to come here and bet on the Super Bowl because it’s such a big event,” Avello said.

#  Bettors taking on Patriots for Super Bowl

There’s a lot of money to be made on the Super Bowl, and many people are looking to the New England Patriots to bring them home. The Pats are currently favored by 3 points over the Los Angeles Rams, and there’s plenty of action on both sides.

Some bettors are confident in the Rams, believing that they can pull off an upset. However, most people seem to think that the Pats will win, and there’s definitely money to be made on that side. If you’re looking to make a bet on the Super Bowl, the Patriots are a good option.

# The Rams Are a Dangerous Team

The Los Angeles Rams have been one of the most dangerous teams in the NFL this year. They went 13-3 during the regular season, and they looked impressive in their win over the Dallas Cowboys in the divisional round.

The Rams have a high-powered offense led by quarterback Jared Goff and running back Todd Gurley. They also have a solid defense, which could give the Patriots some trouble.

# The Patriots Are still Favorites

Despite the Rams’ impressive record and offensive firepower, the New England Patriots are still favored to win. This is largely due to Tom Brady and Bill Belichick, who have been one of the most successful quarterback-coach duos in NFL history.

The Patriots also have plenty of playoff experience, while the Rams are making their first appearance in a Super Bowl since 2001. This could play into New England’s hands as they look to become six-time champions.

#  Bettors making a killing in NFL playoffs

The NFL playoffs are in full swing, and for the savvy bettor, it’s been a profitable few weeks. Bettors who correctly guessed that the Los Angeles Rams would make it to the Super Bowl, for example, are sitting pretty with a +650 return on investment.

But even if you didn’t correctly pick this year’s Super Bowl champion, there have still been plenty of opportunities to make money betting on NFL playoff games. In fact, heading into the conference championships, the cumulative betting record for all postseason games is 134-118-2, a 54.5% win percentage.

So which teams should you back in this weekend’s conference championship games? Here are three tips to help you make some money:

1) Favor the home teams

 statistically speaking, home teams have had a significant advantage in the NFL playoffs over the years. This trend has continued into the 2019 postseason – of the 12 teams that have played so far, 10 have won outright when playing at home.

Given this lopsided statistic, it’s probably not wise to bet against any of the four remaining home teams – the San Francisco 49ers, Kansas City Chiefs, New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. All four squads enter their respective conference championship games as sizable favorites at sportsbooks like Bovada.lv.

2) Bet on underdogs

While home teams have had success so far in the playoffs, underdog teams have actually fared even better. Undefeated against the spread thus far in this year’s postseason are three squads who were seen by many as sizable underdogs heading into their respective playoff matchups: the Philadelphia Eagles (+7 vs Chicago Bears), Houston Texans (+5 vs Buffalo Bills) and Tennessee Titans (+4 vs Baltimore Ravens).

With this knowledge in hand, you may want to consider betting on one or more of this weekend’s underdogs. The Green Bay Packers (+3 vs Seattle Seahawks), Los Angeles Rams (+2.5 vs New Orleans Saints) and Pittsburgh Steelers (+2 vs Kansas City Chiefs) all offer good value as upset picks given their current odds at sportsbooks.

#  Bettors cashing in on college football

A college football resurgence is happening in states such as Nevada and offshore sportsbooks are benefiting from more wagers being placed on the game.

"It seems like there's more interest in college football this year," said Jay Rood, vice president of race and sports for MGM Resorts International. "People are betting more on it."

The gambling market is seeing its share of action, with books taking a total of $158.4 million in bets on college football games so far this season, up from $151.5 million at the same point last year. The Nevada Gaming Control Board reported that football wagers alone totaled $132.5 million in September, surpassing the $130 million wagered in all of September 2016.

"There has been an increase in handle on college football everywhere," said David Payne Purdum, a national gambling reporter for ESPN. "It's not isolated to one state or one offshore book."

While bettors are loading up on favorites such as Alabama and Ohio State, they're also taking chances on longshots like Baylor and Texas A&M. In fact, the combined point spread for all 120 FBS games played thus far is 1,694 points, meaning the average game is decided by about 14 points. That makes it difficult for oddsmakers to set accurate lines, which is why some games have large spreads Vegas likes to avoid taking heavy action on either side.

"We're seeing a lot more two-way action than we ever have before," Rood said. "That makes it tough to handicap games because you really have no idea who is going to cover the spread." 

Offshore sportsbooks are also benefiting from increased interest in college football betting. One book that caters primarily to Americans, Bovada, reports that bettors have wagered $882 million on college football games this season - up from $767 million at the same point last year.

"It's been a great season so far for us with increased betting across the board when comparing 2017 to 2016 numbers," said Kevin Bradley, SportsBook Manager at Bovada.lv "College Football continues to grow in popularity both among recreational and professional bettors."

#  Bettors raking it in with soccer

The global soccer craze shows no signs of abating, with bettors continuing to make healthy profits from the sport. Whether it’s in-game betting, pre-match betting or futures betting, there are plenty of opportunities for making money on soccer.

One key factor that has helped fuel the growth of soccer betting is the immense popularity of the sport. Fans around the world are passionate about their teams and follow them religiously. This means that there is always plenty of action available when betting on soccer games.

In addition, soccer is a relatively low-scoring sport, which makes it more difficult to pick winning bets than in some other sports. This means that bookmakers often offer juicy odds on soccer games, giving bettors a good chance of making a profit.

There are a range of different ways to bet on soccer, with in-game betting being one of the most popular. This involves betting on specific events such as who will score the next goal or who will be shown a card. Bettors can also bet on whether the game will end in a draw or not.

Pre-match betting is also popular, with punters putting money down on teams to win or lose matches. In addition, there are a number of different markets available for punters to wager on, including total goals scored and first goal scorer.

Futures betting is another option for those looking to make money from soccer. This involves predicting which team will win major tournaments such as the World Cup or the Champions League. Punters can also bet on which players will win individual awards such as the Ballon d’Or.

Betting on soccer can be extremely profitable if done correctly. By following trends and keeping up to date with news and injuries, you can give yourself a good chance of making money from this exciting sport. So why not give it a go?
