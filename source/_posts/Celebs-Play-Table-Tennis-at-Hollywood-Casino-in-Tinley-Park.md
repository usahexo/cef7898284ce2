#  Celebs Play Table Tennis at Hollywood Casino in Tinley Park

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson were among the celebrities last night playing table tennis at Hollywood Casino in Tinley Park.

The event was put on by the Foundation for Amateur Tennis (FAT), a not-for-profit organization that provides opportunities for people of all ages to play tennis.

“What an incredible night! We had some amazing celebrities here playing table tennis,” said FAT Executive Director, John Packard.

Packard says the goal of the event was to raise money for underprivileged kids who want to play tennis, but can’t afford it.

In attendance last night were Brady, Johnson, comedian Gabriel Iglesias, actor Patrick Warburton and several others.

#  PokerStars getting into the table tennis game

Since PokerStars announced their new changes to their VIP Club, a lot of players have been up in arms about the way things are going. However, it seems that the company is not resting on its laurels, and has now taken the plunge into the table tennis market.

While this may seem like a strange move at first, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Table tennis is a relatively cheap sport to get into, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It’s also a great way to get some exercise, without having to spend hours at the gym.

PokerStars is not the only company to see the potential in table tennis. In fact, there has been a bit of a resurgence in the sport over the past few years, with major brands like Nike and Adidas getting involved. This has led to an increase in both professional and amateur tournaments, as well as an increase in interest from the general public.

It will be interesting to see how PokerStars approaches table tennis. So far, they have remained tight-lipped about their plans, but we can expect something big from them in the near future. In the meantime, we will just have to sit back and watch as they make their move into this exciting new market.

#  Drake spotted at the casino amidst preparations for a table tennis match

Drake, the popular Canadian rapper was seen at the casino in the city of Toronto this week. He was there to take part in a table tennis match against fellow rapper P Reign. The two were scheduled to play on Thursday night, but Drake didn't seem too keen on the idea as he lost $10,000 in less than an hour at the casino.

Despite his apparent lack of interest in the game, Drake is still expected to show up for the match. Table tennis is a serious business for him, as he has even claimed that he could beat anyone in a one-on-one game. We'll have to wait and see if he can live up to that claim when he takes on P Reign later this week.

Drake is no stranger to taking on other celebrities in sports matches. He's already competed against NBA stars like Jimmy Butler and LeBron James, and has even emerged victorious on a few occasions. It will be interesting to see how he does against P Reign, who is considered by many to be one of Canada's best rappers.

This isn't the first time that Drake has shown up in Toronto out of nowhere. Earlier this year, he made an appearance at a local restaurant and ended up buying everyone dinner. It seems that the rapper just can't stay away from his home country, and we're sure that his fans are glad to have him back in town.

#  Will Russell Westbrook and James Harden finally face off in table tennis?

Will Russell Westbrook and James Harden finally face off in table tennis? The two NBA superstars are pretty evenly matched when it comes to the sport, but who would come out on top if they met in a competitive match?

Westbrook has been practicing for years and is considered one of the best table tennis players in the NBA. He even has his own table tennis paddle endorsement deal. Harden, on the other hand, is a novice player. He has only been playing for a few years and is still learning the game.

If the two players were to face off, it would be a close match. However, Westbrook would most likely come out victorious. He has more experience and is better at reading his opponent’s moves.
