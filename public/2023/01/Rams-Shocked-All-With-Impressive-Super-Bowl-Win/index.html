The team was considered a longshot to win, but they pulled off an impressive upset against the favored New England Patriots.</p>
<p>Rams quarterback Jared Goff had an incredible game, throwing for over 360 yards and three touchdowns. The Rams’ defense was also impressive, shutting down the Patriots’ high-powered offense.</p>
<p>This Super Bowl victory is a major accomplishment for the Rams and their fans. It was a long time coming for this franchise, which last won a championship in 1999.</p>
<p>The Rams are now set to move into their new stadium, which is sure to be rocking after this amazing victory. Congratulations to the Rams on an amazing season!</p>
<h1 id="What-Does-It-Mean-For-The-Rams-Moving-Forward"><a href="#What-Does-It-Mean-For-The-Rams-Moving-Forward" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Mean For The Rams Moving Forward?"></a>What Does It Mean For The Rams Moving Forward?</h1><p>The Rams were controversially traded from St. Louis to Los Angeles in early 2016. The team’s first season in their new home was a disappointment, as they finished 4-12. Looking ahead to the 2017 season, there are several questions about the Rams’ future.</p>
<p>First and foremost, will quarterback Jared Goff improve in his second year? Goff was the first overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draft, but he struggled in his rookie season. He completed just 54.6 percent of his passes and threw more interceptions (seven) than touchdowns (five). To be fair, Goff did not have many good options to throw to; the Rams’ leading receiver last year was Todd Gurley, who caught only 640 yards worth of passes. However, with a year of experience under his belt, Goff should be able to improve this year.</p>
<p>Second, can new head coach Sean McVay turn things around in Los Angeles? McVay is just 31 years old and is the youngest head coach in NFL history. However, he is considered a rising star in the coaching world, having been an assistant coach with the Washington Redskins for seven years. It remains to be seen if McVay can get the most out of his players and lead the Rams to a winning record.</p>
<p>Third, how will defensive tackle Aaron Donald perform this season? Donald is one of the best players in the NFL and was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2014. He had eight sacks last season and is a force to be reckoned with on defense. If he can continue playing at a high level, it will help the Rams become a more competitive team.</p>
<p>Finally, what role will rookie running back Todd Gurley II play this year? Gurley was drafted 10th overall by the Rams in 2015 and had a strong rookie season, rushing for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns. However, he regressed last year due to injuries and finished with just 885 rushing yards. If Gurley can return to form this year, it will take some pressure off of Goff and make the Rams offense more potent.</p>
<p>All eyes will be on the Rams this season as they attempt to bounce back from their disappointing 4-12 campaign in 2016. There are many question marks surrounding this team, but if Jared Goff improves as expected, Sean McVay proves himself as a competent head coach, and Aaron Donald remains one of the best defensive players in the league, there is potential for them to make a playoff run.</p>
<h1 id="Goff-Shines-As-Rams-Make-History"><a href="#Goff-Shines-As-Rams-Make-History" class="headerlink" title="Goff Shines As Rams Make History"></a>Goff Shines As Rams Make History</h1><p>In a game that was rife with playoff implications, the Los Angeles Rams leaned on their star Todd Gurley and got a big performance from Jared Goff to notch their first ever victory in Seattle.</p>
<p>The Rams defense put the clamps on Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson, holding him to just 14 of 27 passing for 198 yards and no touchdowns, while intercepting him twice. On the other side of the ball, Goff connected on 22 of 36 pass attempts for 273 yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>Wide receiver Cooper Kupp had a huge game for the Rams, catching eight balls for 116 yards and a touchdown. The second-year player has been one of Goff’s favorite targets all year long, and he showed why on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gurley carried the ball 20 times for 77 yards and a touchdown, but it was his work as a receiver that caught everyone’s attention. Gurley hauled in seven receptions for 59 yards, both season highs.</p>
<p>The win keeps the Rams in control of their own destiny as they head into the final weeks of the season. A victory next week over the San Francisco 49ers would clinch them a spot in the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Los-Angeles-Rams-Are-NFL-Champions"><a href="#Los-Angeles-Rams-Are-NFL-Champions" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles Rams Are NFL Champions!"></a>Los Angeles Rams Are NFL Champions!</h1><p>The Los Angeles Rams are the new NFL champions after defeating the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Rams quarterback Jared Goff had an MVP-caliber performance, throwing for 377 yards and three touchdowns. Receiver Brandin Cooks had six catches for 137 yards and a touchdown, while Todd Gurley added 115 rushing yards and two touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Rams defense was also dominant, holding Tom Brady and the Patriots offense to just 3 points in the second half. Defensive tackle Aaron Donald was especially outstanding, notching three sacks and five tackles for loss.</p>
<p>It was an amazing team effort by the Rams, and they are now officially the best team in football. Congratulations to Sean McVay, Jared Goff, and the entire Rams organization!</p>
<h1 id="What’s-Next-For-The-Los-Angeles-Rams"><a href="#What’s-Next-For-The-Los-Angeles-Rams" class="headerlink" title="What’s Next For The Los Angeles Rams?"></a>What’s Next For The Los Angeles Rams?</h1><p>The Los Angeles Rams had an impressive 2017-2018 season, finishing with a 13-3 record and making it to the Super Bowl. While they ultimately lost to the New England Patriots, the Rams proved that they are a force to be reckoned with. So what’s next for this team?</p>
<p>One of the things the Rams will need to focus on is their offensive line. In the Super Bowl, quarterback Jared Goff was constantly under pressure, and the team’s running game was nonexistent. The offensive line will need to improve if the Rams want to make it back to the Super Bowl and win.</p>
<p>Another issue that the Rams will need to address is their defense. In the Super Bowl, they were dominated by the Patriots’ offense. The Patriots averaged 9.1 yards per play, while the Rams only averaged 5.0 yards per play. If they want to be successful in future games, the Rams’ defense will need to improve significantly.</p>
<p>Finally, the Rams will need to stay healthy if they want to have another successful season. This season, they were very lucky when it came to injuries; no key players were lost for an extended period of time. However, in future seasons this may not be so fortunate, so they will need to make sure they have good depth at all positions.</p>
<p>Overall, the Rams had a great season and are poised for even more success in future years. They have a young team with a lot of talent, and if they continue to work hard they can achieve great things.</p>
