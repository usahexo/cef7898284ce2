        <h1 id="How-Online-Gambling-was-Born-in-NJ"><a href="#How-Online-Gambling-was-Born-in-NJ" class="headerlink" title="How Online Gambling was Born in NJ"></a>How Online Gambling was Born in NJ</h1><p>In the early days of online gambling, New Jersey was at the forefront of the industry. This is due largely to a few pioneering lawmakers and entrepreneurs who saw the potential of internet-based betting and gaming and were determined to make it a reality in their state.</p>
<p>The seeds of online gambling were sown in New Jersey in the late 1990s when a few enterprising lawmakers recognized the potential of internet-based betting and gaming. At the time, there was a lot of uncertainty about how these activities would be regulated and taxed, but these early adopters forged ahead anyway.</p>
<p>One of the key players in this effort was State Senator Raymond Lesniak, who was instrumental in getting legislation passed that allowed for legal online gambling in New Jersey. Lesniak recognized that online gambling could be a major boon for the state’s economy, and he worked tirelessly to make it a reality.</p>
<p>Another important figure in New Jersey’s online gambling history is Jim Ryan, who served as CEO of Full Tilt Poker from 2004 to 2011. Ryan was one of the early pioneers of online poker, and he played a major role in making it a mainstream activity.</p>
<p>Thanks to the hard work of Lesniak and Ryan, as well as other visionaries like them, New Jersey became one of the first states to legalize online gambling. This gave rise to a number of world-renowned casinos like Tropicana Casino &amp; Resort and Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa. These casinos set the standard for online gaming, and they helped make Atlantic City one of the top tourist destinations in the United States.</p>
<p>Today, New Jersey remains at the forefront of online gambling innovation. The state has been quick to adopt new technologies like virtual reality gaming and augmented reality sports betting, and it continues to attract millions of visitors each year thanks to its world-class casinos and resorts.</p>
<h1 id="How-Atlantic-City-Led-the-Way-in-Online-Gambling"><a href="#How-Atlantic-City-Led-the-Way-in-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How Atlantic City Led the Way in Online Gambling"></a>How Atlantic City Led the Way in Online Gambling</h1><p>Atlantic City has a long and colourful history as one of the leading gambling destinations in the United States. This is in part due to the city’s early embrace of online gambling, which helped to cement its place as a gaming hotspot.</p>
<p>The first online casino licence was granted to Atlantic City in 1996, and this helped to pave the way for other jurisdictions to follow suit. Atlantic City was quick to recognise the potential of online gambling, and it soon became one of the most popular destinations for gamers around the world.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Atlantic City was so successful in terms of online gambling. Firstly, the city has a long history of casino gaming, and this helped to attract players to its online offering. Secondly, Atlantic City had a well-developed infrastructure for online gaming, with a wide range of quality casinos available. And finally, the city offered a safe and secure environment for players, which helped to build confidence in its online offering.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s success in online gambling has seen it become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the US. The city’s casinos continue to thrive, and its reputation as a gaming hotspot is stronger than ever. Thanks to its early adoption of online gambling, Atlantic City is now firmly established as one of the world’s leading gaming destinations.</p>
<h1 id="History-of-Online-Gambling-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#History-of-Online-Gambling-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="History of Online Gambling in New Jersey"></a>History of Online Gambling in New Jersey</h1><p>New Jersey has a long and complicated history with gambling. For many years, there was a ban on all casino gambling in the state. This changed in 1977 when the New Jersey Casino Control Act was passed, which allowed for the operation of riverboats and dockside casinos. </p>
<p>The first casino to open in New Jersey was the Resorts International Hotel and Casino, which opened its doors in 1978. However, this casino was only allowed to offer slot machines, and table games were not legal until 1980. In 1982, the first full-service casino opened in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2013 that online gambling was legalized in New Jersey. At first, only residents of New Jersey were allowed to play online poker and casino games, but this restriction was lifted in 2016. Today, players from around the world can enjoy online gambling in New Jersey casinos. </p>
<p>As of 2019, there are eleven licensed online casinos operating in New Jersey. These casinos offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. In addition to the eleven licensed casinos, there are also several unlicensed offshore sites that accept players from New Jersey. </p>
<p>Since online gambling was legalized in New Jersey, over $2 billion has been wagered on casino games and poker. This makes New Jersey one of the largest online gambling markets in the world. </p>
<p>The success of online gambling in New Jersey has led to calls for it to be legalized in other states. So far, only Nevada and Delaware have followed suit, but more states are likely to legalize online gambling in the future.</p>
<h1 id="The-Evolution-of-Gambling-in-New-Jersey"><a href="#The-Evolution-of-Gambling-in-New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="The Evolution of Gambling in New Jersey"></a>The Evolution of Gambling in New Jersey</h1><p>The gambling industry in New Jersey has come a long way since its early days. The first incarnation of gambling in the state can be traced back to 1894, when horse racing was legalized. This was followed by the legalization of lotteries in 1896, and casinos in 1978.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes to gambling in New Jersey came about in 2013, when online gambling was legalized. This allowed players to gamble from their homes, using their computers or mobile devices. This opened up the industry to a new segment of the population, and led to an increase in revenue for the state.</p>
<p>In addition to online gambling, New Jersey also offers a variety of traditional forms of gambling. These include casino games, horse racing, and lotteries. The casinos offer a wide range of games, including blackjack, poker, and slot machines. There are also a number of different tracks for horse racing, and several different lottery games available.</p>
<p>The growth of the gambling industry in New Jersey has had a positive impact on the state economy. In 2016, the industry generated more than $2 billion in revenue, and supported more than 23,000 jobs. This has helped to boost tourism and create new opportunities for businesses and workers in the state.</p>
<h1 id="From-Land-Based-Casinos-to-Online-Gaming"><a href="#From-Land-Based-Casinos-to-Online-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="From Land Based Casinos to Online Gaming"></a>From Land Based Casinos to Online Gaming</h1><p>The history of casino gaming is an interesting one that starts out with land-based casinos and moves on to online gaming. This article takes a look at the different phases of casino gaming and how it has evolved over the years.</p>
<p>The first phase of casino gaming was when it all began with land-based casinos. These were the very first casinos and they started as a way for people to gamble in a physical location. These casinos were often found in areas that were popular tourist destinations, such as Las Vegas and Atlantic City.</p>
<p>Players would visit these casinos in order to play games such as slots, blackjack, and roulette. There were also tables where players could bet on sports or horses. In most cases, players would need to go to the casino in order to participate in any gaming activities.</p>
<p>This began to change in the 1990s when technology advancements allowed for the development of online casinos. These early online casinos offered many of the same games that could be found in land-based casinos, but players could now access them from their computers or mobile devices.</p>
<p>This opened up gambling opportunities for people who lived in areas where there were no physical casinos and also allowed people to play from anywhere in the world. The growth of online gambling continued into the early 2000s, with more and more people signing up for accounts at various online casinos.</p>
<p>However, there was one problem with early online casinos – they were not regulated. This led to some players being scammed by unscrupulous operators who did not always honor withdrawals or paid out lower returns than advertised. It was this issue that led to the growth of regulated online casinos in the mid-2000s.</p>
<p>Regulated online casinos are those that are licensed and overseen by a governing body such as a national gambling authority. This ensures that players are protected from scams and have faith that their money is safe when playing at an online casino. The growth of regulated online casinos has continued into the present day, with more and more countries licensing these types of operations.</p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a shift away from traditional online casinos towards social media platforms that offer casino-style games. These platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube, allow gamers to play against each other directly or against artificial intelligence (AI) opponents.</p>
<p>This type of gaming is known as “social gaming” and it has become very popular due to its simplicity and ease of use. Players can sign up for free accounts and start playing games within minutes, making it a great choice for those who want quick access to casino games without having to download any software or make any financial commitments.</p>
<p>Social gaming is likely to continue growing in popularity over the coming years as more people become familiar with it and more developers create new games for gamers to enjoy.</p>

The good news is that there is a specific place to report this information, and TurboTax will help you do it correctly.</p>
<p>To report gambling winnings on your tax return, you will need to complete Form 1040, Schedule C. This form is used to report income and losses from self-employment activities. On line 1 of this form, you will enter your total gambling winnings for the year.</p>
<p>If you are using TurboTax, the software will walk you through completing Schedule C correctly. It will ask for specific information about your gambling wins and losses, as well as any associated expenses. TurboTax will automatically calculate your net income or loss from gambling for the year.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that only gambling winnings that are taxable need to be reported on Schedule C. Gambling losses can be deducted from your taxable income, but they must be reported separately on Line 21 of Form 1040.</p>
<p>TurboTax will help you do this as well, by asking specific questions about your gambling losses and then calculating the amount that can be deducted from your taxable income.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling winnings on your tax return, don’t hesitate to contact a tax expert. The team at TurboTax is happy to help you get this information correct and file your taxes quickly and easily.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Enter-Gambling-Winnings-on-Your-TurboTax-Tax-Return"><a href="#How-to-Enter-Gambling-Winnings-on-Your-TurboTax-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="How to Enter Gambling Winnings on Your TurboTax Tax Return"></a>How to Enter Gambling Winnings on Your TurboTax Tax Return</h1><p>If you hit it big at the casino or your state lottery, you may be wondering how to enter gambling winnings on your TurboTax tax return. Here’s a guide to doing just that:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine if your winnings are taxable. Not all gambling income is taxable, so it’s important to determine if your winnings are considered taxable income. For example, gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income, but only up to the amount of your winnings.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report your winnings on Line 21 of your 1040 tax form. This is where you report any other taxable income that you may have received during the year. Be sure to include the full amount of your winnings here, including any taxes that were withheld from them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Claim any applicable deductions. If you had any gambling-related expenses during the year, you may be able to claim them as deductions on your tax return. Deductible expenses could include things like lodging, airfare, and meals while you were traveling for gambling purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use Schedule A if you itemize deductions. If you’re claiming any gambling-related deductions, you’ll need to complete Schedule A and attach it to your 1040 tax return. This schedule allows you to detail all of the deductions you’re taking on your return.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Wait for your refund! Once you’ve filed your tax return and included all of the relevant information about your gambling winnings, sit back and wait for your refund! It may take a few weeks for the IRS to process everything, but eventually you should get your money back in the mail (or deposited directly into your bank account).</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-on-TurboTax"><a href="#How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-on-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="How to Report Gambling Winnings on TurboTax"></a>How to Report Gambling Winnings on TurboTax</h1><p>If you hit it big at the casino or lottery, you’ll need to report your gambling winnings on TurboTax. Here’s a guide on how to do that.</p>
<p>First, make sure that you have reported all of your gambling losses for the year. You can’t report your winnings until you’ve accounted for your losses.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, collect documentation of your winnings. This could include receipts, tickets, or other records of the amount you won.</p>
<p>In TurboTax, enter your gambling income in the “Other Income” section. Report the total amount of your winnings, not just the amount that was subject to tax.</p>
<p>You will also need to report any applicable gambling deductions. These could include things like transportation costs to and from the casino, or hotel costs if you were away from home overnight.</p>
<p>Make sure to review all of the information entered into TurboTax, as it can affect your tax liability. Gambling income is considered taxable income, so it’s important to report it accurately.</p>
<h1 id="What-Forms-to-Use-When-Reporting-Gambling-Winnings-in-TurboTax"><a href="#What-Forms-to-Use-When-Reporting-Gambling-Winnings-in-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="What Forms to Use When Reporting Gambling Winnings in TurboTax"></a>What Forms to Use When Reporting Gambling Winnings in TurboTax</h1><p>Gambling earnings can be a great source of tax-free income for some people, but you need to report them correctly on your tax return. The form you use to report gambling winnings depends on the amount you won and your marital status.</p>
<p>If you won less than $5,000, you only have to report the amount of your winnings on line 21 of Form 1040 as other income. If you won more than $5,000, however, you have to complete Form W-2G and include the full amount of your winnings on line 1.</p>
<p>If you are married and file a joint return, your spouse must also report any gambling winnings he or she may have had on the same form. If you file separately, each spouse must report gambling winnings on a separate Form W-2G.</p>
<p>Reporting gambling winnings is relatively simple, but it’s important to do it correctly so that you don’t end up with a tax bill from the IRS. Make sure to consult with a tax professional if you have any questions about how to report your gambling earnings.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Categorize-Gambling-Winnings-on-Your-TurboTax-Tax-Return"><a href="#How-to-Categorize-Gambling-Winnings-on-Your-TurboTax-Tax-Return" class="headerlink" title="How to Categorize Gambling Winnings on Your TurboTax Tax Return"></a>How to Categorize Gambling Winnings on Your TurboTax Tax Return</h1><p>Are you expecting a big gambling payout this year? Here’s how to report your winnings on your TurboTax tax return.</p>
<p>Gambling winnings are taxable, and you must report them on your tax return. The amount of gambling income you must report depends on the type of gambling you do.</p>
<p>If you gamble in a casino, the amount of winnings you must report is the amount shown on your casino statement minus any losses you reported on your return. If you receive a Form W-2G from the casino, it will show your total gambling winnings and any federal income taxes that were withheld.</p>
<p>If you gamble with a bookie or other individual, the amount of winnings you must report is the fair market value of the winnings on the date they are received. You don’t need to deduct any losses, because there is no statement from the other person documenting them.</p>
<p>If you won a prize in a contest or drawing, the amount of winnings you must report is the fair market value of the prize on the date it was won. This includes cash prizes, trips, cars, and other items. You don’t need to deduct any losses, because there is no statement from anyone documenting them.</p>

<h1 id="What-to-Do-with-Gambling-Winnings-on-TurboTax"><a href="#What-to-Do-with-Gambling-Winnings-on-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="What to Do with Gambling Winnings on TurboTax"></a>What to Do with Gambling Winnings on TurboTax</h1><p>There are a few options for what to do when you have gambling winnings on your TurboTax return. You can claim the winnings as income, subtract the losses from the winnings to avoid paying taxes on the entire amount, or take a tax deduction for gambling expenses.</p>
<p>If you claim the winnings as income, you will have to pay taxes on the full amount. However, if you subtract the losses from the winnings, you will only have to pay taxes on the net amount. This can be helpful if your winnings are relatively small compared to your losses.</p>
<p>You may also be able to take a tax deduction for gambling expenses. This includes things like admission fees, transportation costs, and lodging costs. However, you can only deduct these expenses if they were necessary for you to earn the taxable income. For example, if you stayed at a casino hotel so that you could gamble all day and night, you can deduct the cost of your room. However, if you only gambled for a few hours one evening and then went back to your regular hotel, you cannot deduct the cost of your room.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-on-TurboTax"><a href="#How-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings-on-TurboTax" class="headerlink" title="How to Report Gambling Winnings on TurboTax"></a>How to Report Gambling Winnings on TurboTax</h1><p>If you hit it big at the casino and are wondering how to report gambling winnings on TurboTax, don’t worry – we’re here to help. In this article, we’ll provide a step-by-step guide on how to correctly report your winnings on TurboTax, as well as some important tips to keep in mind. So whether you’re a first-time gambler or a seasoned pro, read on for everything you need to know about reporting gambling winnings on TurboTax.</p>
<p>To begin, you’ll need to gather some information about your gambling activity. This includes the date of your gambling activities, the amount of money you won or lost, and whether any losses were claimed as deductions in previous years. Once you have this information handy, you can start filling out your tax return.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is enter your total gambling income in the “Income” section of your return. This includes all of the income you earned from gambling activities, both wins and losses. You should also note that TurboTax will automatically calculate your losses for you based on the information you provide.</p>
<p>Next, you’ll need to report any winnings that exceed $5,000. To do this, simply fill out Form W2-G and attach it to your tax return. This form reports any taxable gambling winnings that exceed $5,000, and it’s important to note that these winnings are subject to federal income tax.</p>
<p>Finally, if you lost money while gambling in 2018, you may be able to claim those losses as deductions on your tax return. To do this, simply fill out Part II of Form 1040 (the “Other Taxes” section), and enter the amount of your losses in line 28 (other miscellaneous deductions). Keep in mind that only net losses can be claimed as deductions – in other words, subtract any wager or purchase amounts from your gross losses to find your net loss amount.</p>

<h1 id="Which-In-Turn-Will-You-Play"><a href="#Which-In-Turn-Will-You-Play" class="headerlink" title="Which In Turn Will You Play?"></a>Which In Turn Will You Play?</h1><p>Video gaming has now become a household pastime, enjoyed by people of all ages. It wasn’t always this way, however; video games have a long and winding history, full of bizarre and exciting twists and turns.</p>
<p>Like any other form of entertainment, the video game industry owes much to chance and circumstance. In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the most important moments in video game history, from the very first arcade game to the rise of esports.</p>
<p>The Birth of Video Games</p>
<p>Video games as we know them began life in the early ‘70s, when physicist Ralph Baer began work on a television gaming console. This console was different from anything that had come before it; it allowed players to interact directly with on-screen images.</p>
<p>Baer’s invention would lay the groundwork for future gaming consoles, including the Atari 2600 and Nintendo Entertainment System. It also spawned a whole new genre of entertainment – one that quickly became popular among both children and adults.</p>
<p>The Golden Age of Arcade Games</p>
<p>In the early ‘80s, arcade games were all the rage. This was thanks in part to classics like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Space Invaders. These games were simple but addictive, and they quickly became fixtures in arcades across the world.</p>
<p>To capitalize on this trend, Atari released a series of flashier and more complicated arcade games. Titles like Asteroids and Missile Command were huge hits, garnering widespread popularity among gamers young and old.</p>
<p>The Console Wars Begin</p>
<p>In 1985, Nintendo released its Famicom console in Japan. This 8-bit system was a huge success, eventually finding its way to North America under the name NES (Nintendo Entertainment System). With its iconic design and groundbreaking games like Super Mario Bros., NES quickly became one of the most popular gaming consoles ever made.</p>
<p>Atari didn’t take this sitting down; they soon released their own 16-bit console, the Atari Jaguar. However, this system failed to find an audience, due in part to its high price tag ($250) and lack of good games. Ultimately, Nintendo would come out on top in what is now known as The Console War Era .</p>

<p>The event was put on by the Foundation for Amateur Tennis (FAT), a not-for-profit organization that provides opportunities for people of all ages to play tennis.</p>
<p>“What an incredible night! We had some amazing celebrities here playing table tennis,” said FAT Executive Director, John Packard.</p>
<p>Packard says the goal of the event was to raise money for underprivileged kids who want to play tennis, but can’t afford it.</p>
<p>In attendance last night were Brady, Johnson, comedian Gabriel Iglesias, actor Patrick Warburton and several others.</p>
<h1 id="JB-and-Selena-rumored-to-be-playing-ping-pong-tonight"><a href="#JB-and-Selena-rumored-to-be-playing-ping-pong-tonight" class="headerlink" title="JB and Selena rumored to be playing ping pong tonight"></a>JB and Selena rumored to be playing ping pong tonight</h1><p>Apparently, JB and Selena are rumored to be playing ping pong together tonight. This isn’t the first time that the two have been spotted playing ping pong together. In fact, they seem to really enjoy it.</p>
<p>Some people believe that ping pong can help improve relationships because it’s a fun and competitive game. It can also help improve communication between partners. Ping pong is a great way to bond with someone and have some fun at the same time.</p>
<p>JB and Selena are definitely no strangers to rumors, but this one seems pretty legit. We’ll just have to wait and see if they actually play ping pong together tonight. In the meantime, we can all just hope for the best!</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-getting-into-the-table-tennis-game"><a href="#PokerStars-getting-into-the-table-tennis-game" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars getting into the table tennis game"></a>PokerStars getting into the table tennis game</h1><h1 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>Since PokerStars announced their new changes to their VIP Club, a lot of players have been up in arms about the way things are going. However, it seems that the company is not resting on its laurels, and has now taken the plunge into the table tennis market.</p>
<p>While this may seem like a strange move at first, it actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Table tennis is a relatively cheap sport to get into, and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It’s also a great way to get some exercise, without having to spend hours at the gym.</p>
<p>PokerStars is not the only company to see the potential in table tennis. In fact, there has been a bit of a resurgence in the sport over the past few years, with major brands like Nike and Adidas getting involved. This has led to an increase in both professional and amateur tournaments, as well as an increase in interest from the general public.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how PokerStars approaches table tennis. So far, they have remained tight-lipped about their plans, but we can expect something big from them in the near future. In the meantime, we will just have to sit back and watch as they make their move into this exciting new market.</p>

He was there to take part in a table tennis match against fellow rapper P Reign. The two were scheduled to play on Thursday night, but Drake didn’t seem too keen on the idea as he lost $10,000 in less than an hour at the casino.</p>
<p>Despite his apparent lack of interest in the game, Drake is still expected to show up for the match. Table tennis is a serious business for him, as he has even claimed that he could beat anyone in a one-on-one game. We’ll have to wait and see if he can live up to that claim when he takes on P Reign later this week.</p>
<p>Drake is no stranger to taking on other celebrities in sports matches. He’s already competed against NBA stars like Jimmy Butler and LeBron James, and has even emerged victorious on a few occasions. It will be interesting to see how he does against P Reign, who is considered by many to be one of Canada’s best rappers.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time that Drake has shown up in Toronto out of nowhere. Earlier this year, he made an appearance at a local restaurant and ended up buying everyone dinner. It seems that the rapper just can’t stay away from his home country, and we’re sure that his fans are glad to have him back in town.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Russell-Westbrook-and-James-Harden-finally-face-off-in-table-tennis"><a href="#Will-Russell-Westbrook-and-James-Harden-finally-face-off-in-table-tennis" class="headerlink" title="Will Russell Westbrook and James Harden finally face off in table tennis?"></a>Will Russell Westbrook and James Harden finally face off in table tennis?</h1><p>Will Russell Westbrook and James Harden finally face off in table tennis? The two NBA superstars are pretty evenly matched when it comes to the sport, but who would come out on top if they met in a competitive match?</p>
<p>Westbrook has been practicing for years and is considered one of the best table tennis players in the NBA. He even has his own table tennis paddle endorsement deal. Harden, on the other hand, is a novice player. He has only been playing for a few years and is still learning the game.</p>
<p>If the two players were to face off, it would be a close match. However, Westbrook would most likely come out victorious. He has more experience and is better at reading his opponent’s moves.</p>
